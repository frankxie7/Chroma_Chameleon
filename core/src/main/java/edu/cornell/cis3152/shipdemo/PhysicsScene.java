/*
 * PhysicsScene.java
 *
 * This lab is composed of three minigames. Instead of repeating physics code
 * over-and-over, we pull it out into a common subclass. However, in most cases
 * you would just combine this class with your game scene (e.g. RocketScene,
 * RagdollScene, or PlatformScene). Unless your game has a lot of minigames
 * (unlikely) you should not need to architect your code this way.
 *
 * For the most part, this class is like CollisionController from previous labs.
 * It handles the physics, while gameplay is handled in the specific minigame
 * subclass. With that said, there is not much to do for collisions; Box2d takes
 * care of all of that for us. This controller invokes Box2d and then performs
 * any after the fact modifications to the data. These modifications are then
 * interpretted by the subclasses to create gameplay.
 *
 * If you study this class and the GDIAC API package, you should be able to
 * understand how the Physics engine works.
 *
 * Based on the original PhysicsDemo Lab by Don Holden, 2007
