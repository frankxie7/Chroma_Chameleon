# Chroma Chameleon

## Description
A failed experiment by a group of rogue scientists unleashed Chroma â€” a super-intelligent chameleon with a nifty knack for spitting out different patterns of paint. 
Navigate this creature, with its newly acquired party trick, through an evil lab rigged with all kinds of danger. Help Chroma search for his way out while 
evading those determined to capture the lab's greatest mistake.
